# Financial Data Analysis — Bond end of the month effects

This project investigates the **effects of End-Of-Month (EOM)** phenomena on bond returns. Through historical bond data, the notebook explores whether bonds exhibit any 
patterns or anomalies related to the month-end timing and how those may impact returns or risk.

# Data

- The analysis uses historical bond data of TLT etf from https://finance.yahoo.com/  
- Any additional pre-processing steps (cleaning, filtering, resampling) are handled within the notebook.

# Analysis Methodology

1. Load and prepare bond data  
2. Compute returns, monthly statistics, and EOM-related metrics  
3. Visualize patterns around month ends  
4. Interpret whether EOM effects are economically significant
